This is a random collection of utilities I use.

### shell/indent-project.sh

This will go through all html, erb, js, css, and haml files and replace tabs with 2 spaces and replace 4 spaces with 2. I mostly use this on things like download design sites. Definitely test this on something that's in source control as it might not do exactly what you want. It's been mostly tests on html files.
